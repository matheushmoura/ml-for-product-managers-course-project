Predicting Electrical Energy Output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant
This is the final project for the "Machine Learning Foundations for Product Managers" course. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the net hourly electrical energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) using ambient environmental readings from sensors at the plant.

Project Overview
The Combined Cycle Power Plant generates power using a combination of gas turbines, steam turbines, and heat recovery steam generators. We will develop a predictive model using a dataset of 9,568 hourly average readings of various environmental conditions, such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and exhaust vacuum, to predict the plant's electrical energy output.

This project will be peer-graded based on the following four key elements:

Modeling Approach: Correct identification of the type of modeling task, features, and algorithms.
Model Building: Comparison of at least two different models or combinations of features/hyperparameters using validation techniques.
Model Evaluation: Selection of an appropriate evaluation metric and calculation of model performance.
Model Interpretation: Clear communication and interpretation of the model's performance.
Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 9,568 rows of hourly average readings from sensors at a power plant. The variables include:

Temperature (T): Ranges from 1.81°C to 37.11°C
Ambient Pressure (AP): Ranges from 992.89 to 1033.30 millibar
Relative Humidity (RH): Ranges from 25.56% to 100.16%
Exhaust Vacuum (V): Ranges from 25.36 to 81.56 cm Hg
Net hourly electrical energy output (PE): Target variable, ranges from 420.26 to 495.76 MW
